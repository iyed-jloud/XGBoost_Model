# Li-Ion Battery RUL Prediction (Digital Twin & XGBoost)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Predictive Maintenance** for Lithium-Ion batteries within the context of **Industry 4.0**. The goal is to estimate the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of a critical battery system before failure occurs.

To ensure robustness and reproducibility, this project implements a **Digital Twin** approach based on the **NASA PCoE (Prognostics Center of Excellence)** dataset (Battery B0005). Instead of relying on static CSV files, the system mathematically models the physicochemical degradation of the battery to generate high-fidelity training data.

## Repository Structure
This repository demonstrates a progression from theoretical machine learning to applied engineering:

| File | Description | Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`01_XGBoost_Fundamentals.ipynb`](./01_XGBoost_Fundamentals.ipynb)** | Introduction to XGBoost using the classic Boston Housing dataset. | Educational |
| **[`02_RUL_Battery_Project.ipynb`](./02_RUL_Battery_Project.ipynb)** | **Main Project:** Digital Twin generation and RUL prediction. | **Industrial** |

## Technical Stack
* **Algorithm:** XGBRegressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** `xgboost`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
* **Methodology:** Digital Twin, Synthetic Data Generation, Regression Analysis.

## The "Digital Twin" Architecture
To overcome the limitations of external datasets (broken links, inconsistent formats), I reverse-engineered the degradation profile of the **NASA B0005 Battery**. The code includes a physics-based generator that simulates:

1.  **Capacity Fade:** Modeled using a polynomial decay function derived from real NASA data ($Capacity = f(Cycles)$).
2.  **Sensor Noise:** Gaussian noise injection to simulate real-world sensor inaccuracies.
3.  **Variable Inputs:**
    * **Voltage ($V$):** Terminal voltage drop simulation.
    * **Temperature ($T$):** Heat generation correlative to internal resistance increase.

**Why this matters:** This makes the algorithm **autonomous** and deployable in offline environments without external dependencies.

## Model Performance
The model was trained on the generated Digital Twin data and evaluated on a hold-out test set (20%).

* **Metric:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* **Result:** **MSE ≈ 2.00** (RMSE ≈ 1.4 cycles)
* **Precision:** The model predicts the remaining life of the battery with an accuracy of **>99%**.
